# Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) for MNIST

## 🖼️ Introduction
This project implements a **Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)** to generate handwritten digits similar to those in the **MNIST dataset**. The GAN consists of:
- A **Generator** that creates realistic fake images.
- A **Discriminator** that distinguishes real images from fake ones.
- An **adversarial training process** where both networks improve over time.

## 📌 Features
✅ **Trains a GAN model** on the MNIST dataset.  
✅ **Generates realistic handwritten digits** after training.  
✅ **Uses PyTorch** for deep learning implementation.  
✅ **Includes visualization** of generated samples after each epoch.  
✅ **Optimized training loop** with `tqdm` progress bar.
